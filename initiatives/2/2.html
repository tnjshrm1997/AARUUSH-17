</span><br><span style="float:left;margin-left:150px;"><b>Mission</b> – To create awareness in society on how to protect dogs from any harm and promote their healthy living.
</span><br><br><span style="text-align:center;margin-left:15px;">WOOF(Welfare Of Oppressed Friends) aims to help the condition of the most innocent animals dogs and making their lives a little better with efforts of Aaruush. It has been scientifically proven that dogs are as delicate as a human child. We hope with the start of this campaign we can make this society a beer place for human’s best friend. Due to high cost, rabies vaccines are not readily available across local health centers in India which in turn forces people to delay their treatment. This initiative aims to make everyone aware about the need for proper treatment and medication that needs to be provided to stray dogs and help them live peacefully and happily. WOOF also aims to provide awareness about the vaccination and promise ourselves that when we look at a dog, we don’t see it just like an animal but like a friend who just needs love and affection. They’re like angels in this world and some choose fur over wings.
